# MonitorNoHandle syntax
# On Windows systems only, the MonitorNoHandle input monitors files without using Windows file handles. This lets you read special log files like the Windows DNS server log files.
# You must specify a valid path to a file when you use the MonitorNoHandle input stanza. You cannot specify a directory. If you specify a file that already exists, Splunk Enterprise does not index the existing data in the file. It only indexes new data that the system writes to the file.
# MonitorNoHandle sets the source for files you monitor to MonitorNoHandle.To specify the file name as the source, you must use the source setting in the stanza for the MonitorNoHandle input for the file.
# You can only configure MonitorNoHandle on a Windows machine with inputs.conf or the Command Line Interface (CLI). You cannot configure it in Splunk Web or on a *nix machine.

[MonitorNoHandle://<path>]
disabled=0
source = <path>
<setting1> = <val1>
<setting2> = <val2>

# Batch syntax
# Use batch to set up a one-time, destructive input of data from a source.
# For continuous, non-destructive inputs, use monitor. Splunk enterprise deletes data that it has indexed with the batch monitor.

[batch://<path>]
move_policy = sinkhole
<setting1> = <val1>
<setting2> = <val2>

# When you define batch inputs, you must include the setting move_policy = sinkhole. This loads the file destructively.
# Do not use the batch input type for files that you do not want to delete after indexing.
# To ensure that Splunk Enterprise indexes new events when you copy over an existing file with new contents, set the CHECK_METHOD = modtime setting in props.conf for the input source.
# This checks the modification time of the file and re-indexes it when the time changes. Splunk Enterprise indexes the entire file, which can result in duplicate events.

# Examples of monitor input stanzas
# Single *nix file
# This example stanza configures Splunk Enterprise to index the single file, /var/log/messages.

[monitor:///var/log/messages]
disabled = 0
sourcetype = unixlog
Single Windows directory

# This Windows example configures Splunk Enterprise to monitor the directory, C:\Windows\Logs. and all the files in it.

[monitor://C:\Windows\Logs]
disabled = 0
Multiple Windows directories

# This Windows example tells Splunk Enterprise to monitor all of the directories in C:\Windows\Debug.

[monitor://C:\Windows\Debug\*]
disabled = 0
Multiple *nix directories with a wildcard

# This example configures Splunk Enterprise to monitor directories like /apache/foo/log, /apache/bar/log, etc.

[monitor:///apache/.../logs]
Multiple *nix files in one directory with a wildcard
This *nix example configures Splunk Enterprise to monitor multiple files in one directory, such as /apache/*.log.

[monitor:///apache/*.log]
MonitorNoHandle, single Windows file

# This Windows example uses the MonitorNoHandle input to monitor a file that Windows has open for writing, such as C:\Windows\System32\DNS\DNS.log.

[MonitorNoHandle://<path>]
disabled = 0
source = <path>
<setting1> = <val1>
<setting2> = <val2>

# Batch
# This batch example loads and deletes all files from the directory system/flight815/.

[batch://system/flight815/*]
move_policy = sinkhole

# Monitor non-default Windows event logs
# You can also configure Splunk Enterprise to monitor non-default Windows event logs. Before you can do this, you must import them to the Windows Event Viewer.
# After you import the logs, you can add them to your local copy of inputs.conf, as follows:

[WinEventLog://DNS Server]

[WinEventLog://Directory Service]
